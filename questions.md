### Ande's Requirements
So an app or program that can take 10 venues, some number of teams and multiple variables to create a X week schedule. This would require to have "black out" dates for teams or venues and meet certain parameters such as 2 travel games or every team gets 2 double headers.

Rivalries, travel restrictions, double header minimum things like that.

Days venue is not available or teams request to not play.

### Questions

- Can players belong to multiple teams? Mayhaps.
- Do we need to schedule umpires/staff?

#### Role Structure?
- Player
    - Can only view all scheduled games.
- Team Manager
    - Can manage the schedule for their assigned team.
- Administrator
    - Can manage all schedules for all teams and manage roles.
